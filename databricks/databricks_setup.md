1. Initialize Databricks Environment
   - Since the project uses Databricks Community Edition, which auto-terminates after one hour of inactivity, the computing resources need to be initialized manually when needed.
   - Log in to Databricks and start the required computing resources.
2. Install Required Libraries in Databricks
   - Install the following libraries in your Databricks environment:
     * Spark NLP (spark-nlp Python library)
     * Spark NLP for Apache Spark (com.johnsnowlabs.nlp:spark-nlp_2.12:5.1.4 Maven library)
     * ClickHouse JDBC (com.clickhouse:clickhouse-jdbc:0.5.0 Maven library)
     * Hadoop AWS (org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-aws:3.2.0 Maven library)
